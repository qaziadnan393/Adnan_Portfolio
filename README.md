## [Project 1: Western Health WIES prediction modelling](https://github.com/qaziadnan393/Western-Health-Machine-learning)
Western Health Australia is a Public hospital which serves a population of approximately 800,000 people in western region of Melbourne.

- Developed a Machine Learning model (99% accuracy) to predict Weighted Inlier Equivalent Separation.
- Maintained large databases and used various professional statistical techniques to collect, analyse, and interpret data from customers and partners.
- Identified and reported any data issues, conducted detailed weekly reports, and pro-actively participated in team meetings with managers.
- Conducted interviews with key business users to collect information on business processes and user requirements.
- Contributing to the organisation’s efforts for optimisation through predictive & prescriptive analytics, effectively reducing the current manual process and hence the turnaround time of 20 days.
- Assisted Western health with a blueprint model for a WIES prediction which is considered and implemented by their organization.
- Tech Stack: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Machine learning, Prediction Modelling, Tableau, Power BI.
